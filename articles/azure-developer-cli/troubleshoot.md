# Troubleshoot Azure Developer CLI Preview

This article provides solutions to common problems that might arise when you're using Azure Developer CLI (azd) Preview.

## Get help and give feedback

If you're unable to find what you're looking for in this article or you want to provide feedback, you can post questions to [Azure Developer CLI Discussions](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev/discussions).

You can also report bugs by opening GitHub Issues in the [Azure Developer CLI GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/azure-dev).

## The .azure directory

Azure Developer CLI assumes that any directories that are stored in the `.azure` directory are Azure Developer CLI environments. Don't run Azure Developer CLI commands from the home directory of a user that has the Azure CLI installed.

## Not logged in to Azure or token expired in Visual Studio

After you've run `azd init -t <template-name>` in Visual Studio, you get the following error: "To access remote: this repository, you must reauthorize the OAuth Application `Visual Studio`."

### Solution

Run `azd login` to refresh the access token.

## Azure Bicep CLI requirement

`azd up` and `azd provision` require the latest release of Azure Bicep CLI. You might get the following error message: "Error: failed to compile bicep template: failed running Az PowerShell module bicep build: exit code: 1, stdout: , stderr: WARNING: A new Bicep release is available: v0.4.1272."

### Solution

Upgrade Bicep CLI by running `az bicep upgrade`.

## `azd up` or `az provision` fails

Things can sometimes go awry with `azd up` or `azd provision`. Common errors include:
* "Can't provision certain resources in an Azure region because the region is out of capacity."
* "Relevant resource provider isn't present in that region."

The troubleshooting steps might differ, depending on the root cause.

### Solution

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Locate your resource group, which is rg-\<your-environment-name>.

1. Select **Deployments** to get more information.

1. Verify that you've specified an environment name that's the same as your environment name.

1. Go to `https://github.com/<your repo>/actions`, and then refer to the log file in the pipeline run for more information.

## 'azd monitor' for development container

`azd monitor` is currently not supported if you use a development container as your development environment.

## Text-based browser support

Text-based browsers are currently not supported by `azd monitor`.

## Live metrics support for Python

Live Metrics (`azd monitor --live`) is currently not supported for Python apps. For more information, see [Live Metrics: Monitor and diagnose with 1-second latency](/azure/azure-monitor/app/live-stream#get-started).
