# Azure Developer CLI reference (preview)

This article explains the syntax and parameters for the various Azure Developer CLI Preview commands.

## azd

Azure Developer CLI is a command-line interface for developers who build Azure solutions.

### Synopsis

Azure Developer CLI is a command-line interface for developers who build Azure solutions.

To begin working with Azure Developer CLI, run the `azd up` command by supplying a sample template in an empty directory:

```		
azd up –-template todo-nodejs-mongo
```

You can pick a template by running `azd template list` and then supplying the repo name as a value to `–-template`.
		
The most common next commands are:

```	
azd pipeline config
azd deploy
azd monitor --overview
```
	
For more information, visit the [Azure Developer CLI Dev Hub](./overview.md).

### Options

```
-C, --cwd string           Sets the current working directory.
    --debug                Enables debugging and diagnostics logging.
-e, --environment string   The name of the environment to use.
-h, --help                 Gets help for Azure Developer CLI.
    --no-prompt            Accepts the default value instead of prompting, or it fails if there is no default.
```

Examples:

```
azd deploy
azd deploy –-service api
azd deploy –-service web
```

After the deployment is complete, the endpoint is printed. To start the service, select the endpoint or paste it in a browser.

```
