# How to install Azure library packages for JavaScript

The Azure SDK for JavaScript is composed solely of many individual libraries that can be installed in standard JavaScript environments.

Libraries for standard JavaScript environments are listed in the [package index](../azure-sdk-library-package-index.md). Azure packages have names that begin with the `@azure` scope.

With these Azure libraries you can provision and manage resources on Azure services (using the management libraries, whose names begin with `@azure/arm-`) and connect with those resources from app code.

## Install the latest version of a library

# [npm](#tab/npm-install)

```cmd
npm install <library>
```

`npm install` retrieves the latest version of a library in your current JavaScript environment.

You can use any package name listed in the [package index](../azure-sdk-library-package-index.md).

# [yarn](#tab/yarn-install)

```cmd
yarn add <library>
```

`yarn add` retrieves the latest version of a library in your current JavaScript environment.

You can use any package name listed in the [package index](../azure-sdk-library-package-index.md).
