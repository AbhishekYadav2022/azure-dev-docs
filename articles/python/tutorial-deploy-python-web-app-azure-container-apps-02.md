# Build and deploy a Python web app with Azure Container Apps and PostgreSQL

This article is part of a tutorial about how to containerize and deploy a Python web app to Azure Container Apps. Container Apps enable you to deploy containerized apps without managing complex infrastructure. 

In this part of the tutorial, you learn how to build containerized Python web app from a sample app (Django or Flask version). You build the container image in the cloud and deploy it to Azure Container Apps.  A Service Connector enables the container to connect to an Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server instance, where the sample app stores data.

The service diagram shown below highlights the components covered in this article.
